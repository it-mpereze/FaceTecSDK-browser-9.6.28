# QuickStart

1. Update Config.js with your FaceTec DeviceKeyIdentifier (get this from your Developer Account page <https://dev.facetec.com/#/account>).
2. From the extracted directory run:
   1. "npm install"
   2. "npm run facetec-browser-sdk"
3. To build the TypeScript sample, you will need to open a new window and navigate to the sample-app-ts directory.
   Follow the steps in the README.
4. If your Browser does not open automatically, navigate to â€œlocalhost:8000"
